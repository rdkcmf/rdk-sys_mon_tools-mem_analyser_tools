# this script uses the memstress program to alloate a certain amount of memory
# memset it to random numbers and exit once it is done
# this can be used to check the speed of memeory in case of random numbers writes. 
# keep in mind rand() takes a lot of cpu cycles and speed will be way lower tha cont writes
# you should also run const check to get full picture
# the total block size should be set to about 30MB less than max number that you got from
# oom size finder script as last 30 or so MB will be extremely slow. It is better to find 
# /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes and reduce that from maximum from speedtest to get the best 
# results.

# calculate output file names
